Overview of a games store business performance
# Games Store Analysis
## Context
We are employed as Data Analysts for a gaming business with 349 brick & mortar stores nationwide. Business executives have asked us to provide them with dashboards showing how the business is performing to help them with business decisions. Executives have advised us that they don't have any dashboards currently and haven't provided us with any direction on what that they would like to be delivered. This is not an uncommon scenario in the real world, where a business unit doesn't have any dashboards or any reports that have been created. In these situations is upto us, as Data Analysts, to create these dashboards and reports. It's also not uncommon where you get some guidenace from stakeholders, but no further details on what report they would like specifically, which metrics they would like to see or any examples or mock ups of what they're after. 
- We need to determine which metrics are most important

  from
    customers c
  where
